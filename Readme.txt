Integration-Project-AISS


This is the integration project for the course "Architecture and Integration of Software Systems" in the second year of the Software Engineering degree program at the University of Seville.

The project consists of three APIs that collect data from GitHub and GitLab, storing it in the GitHubMiner and GitLabMiner APIs, respectively. Both are connected to the GitMiner API, which retrieves and centralizes data from both APIs. Additionally, some tests conducted with Postman are included.

It is important to note that in the files named "Services," the authentication tokens for GitHub and GitLab must be filled in for the system to function correctly.
